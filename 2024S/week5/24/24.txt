Problem 24

This problem concerns *requests* being treated by a customer support.

Requests arrives at 8:00 and must be serviced before the end of the day (24:00).

Requests are classified according to a predetermined list of topics.

Each member of the support staff has responsibility for one or more of these topics and each topic has one or more support personel assigned to it.

Each staff member has a prioritized list of topics to handle.

Staff personel are not permitted to handle requests that are outside of their specified areas.

When staff members become available, they select from the pool of waiting requests according to their priority list of topics.

Requests are available for allocation immediately after arriving.

If two staff members are simultaneously available, *scheduling preference* is given to the one whose most recent job was scheduled earliest ( need to keep track to the last request treated ). 
If there is a tie, scheduling preference is given to the person whose *id* number appears earlier in the input list of staff people.

At initialization, all staff members are available to handle requests.
