# NDHU_OJ_Codes
This is a repository for the solutions of the Psets of the Lab of computer programming of NDHU CSIE department.
After solving a problem, I try to do a small report on :
* The process I went through to solve the problem;
* What concepts were used;
* Why every step is necessary;
* How can this solution be improved;
* How can the concepts learned can be applied to solve other real-life problems.
